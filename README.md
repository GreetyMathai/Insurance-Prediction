# Insurance-Prediction

In this project a model has been build to predict the insurance charges according to the customer data provided

Here I have used 4 different machine learning algorithms:
1. Linear Regression model
2. Multiple Regression model
3. Decision Tree Model
4. Random Forest Model

Comparing all the scores of the algorithm, I have created the model for this dataset
Further I have also predicted the charges for a test dataset of the same type
